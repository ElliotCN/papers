# Title
Aircarft and simulated Measurments of biomass buring aerosol over West-Africa

# Author 
Elliot Cooksey-Nash, John Simth

# Intoduction 
Bio Mass buring areosal are important for the radius of effect but the magnitude and even distribution are not understood.
see Haywood et al (2000)
Our measurments add to the knowledge using a mass spectrometer data (allan et al (1996))

#Simulations
Johns box model shows consitancy with aircraft measurments

Im making some sweet sweet changes to see what happens

#methodology 

we used a TOF-AWs to measure the aerosol content of the air
