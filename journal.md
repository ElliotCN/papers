# Title
Aircarft and simulated Measurments of biomass buring aerosol over West-Africa

# Author 
Elliot Cooksey-Nash, John Simth

# Intoduction 
Bio Mass buring areosal are important for the radius of effect but the magnitude and even distribution are not understood.
see Haywood et al (2000)
Our measurments add to the knowledge using a mass spectrometer data (allan et al (1996))

#Simulations
Johns box model shows consitancy with aircraft measurments

Im making some sweet sweet changes to see what happens

#methodology 

we used a TOF-AWs to measure the aerosol content of the air.

# instrumentation
concentration was measured using a 'chicken' sandwhich 

# Results
We report changing compostion with atmospheric change which is directly linked to somthing or other

#Figures
Draft where figure will be in finished paper

#conclusion
Should be all alright and the chicken sandwhich was very nice
